# Reflection – Daily Schedule Simulator

## What was your approach to designing the schedule?
I designed my scheudle to follow my track and field and school work schedule. also with moods to give it a more human approach to show how each day would feel.

## What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?
The most challenging part was understanding that all setTimeout calls run by themselves. Even though they are written in order, they depend on their delay value.

## What does this assignment teach you about async code?
This assignment shows that asynchronous code does not wait for previous lines to finish. Unlike a normal script, the timing determines execution order rather than position in the file.

## What creative element did you add?
I added random mood emojis to simulate how energy and schedules can change from day to day.

## How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?
The project simulates the sequence of events well, but it simplifies real life because each event instantly replaces the previous one. In real life most activities often overlap or take unpredictable amounts of time.
